**Day 10: Saturday, March 21**

Today I'm trying to stop worrying about the future and just be _present_.  I need to appreciate and enjoy the gifts God has given me, that I have right now.  The future will come, and there's no reason to borrow trouble.

I went with Kate to the post office as she mailed off some packages of clothes she's sold.  The lady at the count was pretty funny.  She hated wearing a mask and said, "one day you'll come in here and find me hanging by my mask."

I went to Academy Sports to get some dummy shells for teaching people how to load the shotgun.  I bought some long-distance walkie-talkies, more shotgun shells and a MOLLE pouch to hold them.

The weather was really nice-bright and sunny and cool.

We decided to the the wood for the deck, but when I got to Lowe's, my anxiety got the best of me, and I just had to go home.  I think this is the first time in over a year that something like this happened. I think the responsibility and uncertainty just caught up with me.  I was/am okay, I just needed to go home and calm down away from the news and numbers.

I took a nap on the couch and Tom said I was talking in my sleep again.

The boys finished the Lego Millenium Falcon.

This last week I've had a lot of time talkint with Kate, and that's been really good for us.  She's so smart, and has grown into a wonderful woman.

Dani and I went for a long walk today.  When we got home, Adam across the street was just getting back from a bike ride.  He said his dad is getting worse, but he's not allowed to go visit him.  I don't know if it's because he has the virus, or if he's in a medical facility on lockdown in general.  He thinks this will blow over in a few weeks.

They announced Jackson, Johnson, and Wyandotte counties will start a stay-at-home order on Tuesday.  It will be enforced by ticketing.  Parks and mass transit will still be open.

There's something going on where the DOJ wants some measures approved where they can jail people indefinitely and without trial as a response to this situation.  Both R's and D's in Congress are flipping out, and for good reason.

### Testing ###

Due to the shortage of test, they want to change the standard for who gets tested.

Up until now, they've only been testing critical cases.  Now, they want to only test people [if the result would change the direction of treatment](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/22/health/us-coronavirus-wrap-sunday/index.html). Hypothetically, if a Dr thinks a person has lung cancer, they'll probably do a COVID-19 test to ensure they won't need to treat their respiratory issues differently.

This is really, really bad for us.  The lack of tests means we have no idea how many people are infected, hospitalized, in critical condition, or have died from the Coronavirus.  Of course, this affects how policymakers plan and make decisions, but it also lets the local public know how bad their situation is.  For instance, we might have 50 people dying of COVID-19 at Belton Regional, but no one would know it, so people would think they can go about their everyday lives.
