title: Settling In...?
---
**Day 8: Thursday, March 19**

I'm starting to settle into this new way of life now.  Things don't feel as strange, but I'm also working a lot.

Dani says I've been talking a lot in my sleep the last two nights.

In Trump's press conference today, he said some malaria drug was approved to treat coronavirus. Immediately following, the FDA said this was false.

We officially have cases in Belton and Raymore now.  Total in Cass County is now 4.  There's a decent chance that the mother of one of Kate's coworkers might be one of those cases.  I'm glad she's not going back to work.

Nurses in the area are filling out forms to let them pass through checkpoints/roadblocks to get to work.  There have been no public discussions of lockdowns or martial law.  It's coming.

I took some cash out of the bank today, just in case.

Senators Kelly Loeffler and Richard Burr were caught insider trading after they attended classified meetings in January.  They sold off millions of dollars of stocks in response.  Loeffler then bought stock in a remote working company.

Dani's mom just said she's also heard rumors of martial law at work.
