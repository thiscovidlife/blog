**Day 6: Tuesday, March 17**

Brief Notes:

Kate, Tom, and I had teeth dreams last night.

Dani is having a hard time focusing, she's glued to the numbers.

I met with Mike R. and Aaron C.  Discussed no on-site meetings anymore -- all services online.  Mike had dinner out with his in-laws on Saturday.  They came from a funeral in PA and had been through 15 states recently.  Mike also attended the celebration of life for Cayle's Dad, who died of cancer a week ago.  This was also on Saturday, and there were 100-150 people there.  Mike needs to self-quarantine.

Mom went to a Dr/Disability appointment, then grocery shopping. Dad stayed in the truck the entire time.

Kate's friend, OP, is back from college.  Kate's scheduled to work at her fast food job on Friday.  She got her hair cut last Friday.  It's short and looks so nice.

John & Tom played Minecraft _all day_.

Italy is burning down and Spain and France aren't far behind.

Kansas shut down their public schools for the rest of the year.  They'll continue online.

Jackson County  had its first two cases today.
