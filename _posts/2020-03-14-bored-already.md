**Day 3: Saturday, March 14**

They're planning on having church tomorrow, and we're not going.  I can't believe Mike wants to have it.

We sat around the house all day, constantly checking for news on social media and trying to distract ourselves.  We're in shock.

Missouri had 6 cases by the end of the day today.

We're discussing moving the weight bench into our recently-cleaned garage, but Haley wants us to wait a week or so to see if this really pans out.
