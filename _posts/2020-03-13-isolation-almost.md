**Day 2: Friday, March 13**

I got permission yesterday to work from home today.  I'm very worried --almost scared-- that my Mom and Dad won't survive this.

Right now they're saying people over 60 are at a high risk of death, and those with comorbidities (like smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, autoimmune disorders, etc) are at a higher risk as well.

Italy has found that although people in their 40s might survive this, their lungs get ripped up, leading to months of therapy and scarring that will affect their respiratory system for the rest of their lives.

Today I went to the office for just a while to fill out some paperwork and attend a meeting where they outlined how work will go in the near future.  Basically we'll be working from home and calling in for meetings, unless an in-person meeting is necessary.  I think it's quite fair.

I took the boys to Walmart last night to get some snack for my Mom, and things were surprisingly normal (if a little picked over).

People have been fighting to stockpile toilet paper.  Nobody really knows why, they just do it.

Trump held a press conference yesterday where he announced a website that will help triage people for drive-through testing.  After the presser, Google (the site's developer) said they were still in the early stages of development, and that it would be first piloted locally in San Fransico.  Basically, Trump lied about the progress and scope of the site.

We don't have enough tests.  They've been promising millions of them for the last two weeks.
