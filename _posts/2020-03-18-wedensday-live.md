**Day 7: Wednesday, March 18**

Today we launched a new website at work.  It was super easy, but everyone was so impressed that there were no issues.  Big win for me.

I asked Kate not to go into work on Friday. Even though they will only have the drive through open, we just can't chance her bringing something home.  I feel terrible about it, but it could save lives here in our house.  The upside is that people want her shift because they need to work so badly.

Saw an article today on CNN about [why you should keep your money in the bank](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/economy/banks-cash-coronavirus/index.html).  Nothing suspicious there.

Omaha is shutting down their Public Schools.  Classes will continue online.

I held my first youth group meeting via Facebook Live video today.  It was odd just talking at a camera with no feedback.  I wish I could have led a discussion instead of just running my mouth.

For comaraderie at work, we started having brief meetings at the end of hte day as a chance to reconnect.  I can tell people are going to get lonely.

Dani had Dr. T day, where kids meet with the psychiatrist. Every month is hard.  She hears their heartbreaking stories in detail.  This time was exceptionally hard because in addition to the COVID-19 stress, the stories were exceptionally bad.  Poor kids.  Poor Dani.

The stock market dropped something like another 1,300 points, erasing all growth since Trump took office.  This has been his only redeeming quality in his followers' eyes.

Blah.  This is going to be a long time, isn't it?
