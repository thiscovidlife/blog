**Day 11: Sunday, March 22**

I haven't been sleeping well.  I got to sleep around 11 or midnight and wake up around 4:30-5:30 every day.

We got the kids up for church and we all watched the livestream on Facebook.  It was just our worship leader, a pianist, and the pastor, streaming from the church.  The building was closed to everyone else, because if people knew the doors were open, they'd show up, and that just wouldn't be safe.

It was nice having church in our pajamas, but most of us fell asleep during the sermon.  I suppose I can see why the old pews were so hard and uncomfortable compared to a couch.

They announced new "guidelines" for the state of Missouri.  Basically it's just stay at home as much as possible, and no gatherings of more than 10 people.

Dani's having a hard time with this.  Her sleep is off, and she's the person probably most on her phone (although I give her some stiff competition there).

She cooked an amazing dinner of pork loin, mashed potatoes, and green beans.  Mom & Dad ate with us, and it was a good time.

I took the kids up to the church building after dinner so they could rock out.  It was a lot of fun.  I think they just needed some space to be crazy.  Kate and Tom had a yelling contest to see who could scream the loudest.  I played guitar, with John on drums and Tom on bass, then we switched it up: Tom too drums, John got on guitar, and Kate played bass.

Those kids bring me so much joy.  I'm so proud of them, not just as individuals, but as a group -- as sibilngs.

Nobody has kids like mine.

John woke us up at 1:30 AM (early Monday morning) to tell us he heard a "fleshy squeak" in his room.  He woke up Tom and Tom heard it coming from the vent.  John was pretty freaked out, and the boys ended up sleeping on couches.  Weird.

The tensions is building out there.  Rand Paul was the first Senator confirmed with COVID-19.  There are almost no N95 masks left.  People are making masks from cloth for medical workers.  Places are using trash bags as gowns.  Italy isn't putting anyone over 60 on a ventilator.  New York state called for recently retired medical professionals to volunteer for service.  New York City's streets are dead except for overlapping ambulance sirens.  Fewer people are out.  Canada said they will not attend the Olympics if they are held this summer.

I taught the boys to load and unload the shotgun.

God has been good to us by granting us health today.  It is a gift, not something he owes us, so we will enjoy it and be thankful for it.  The day may come when he chooses to take it back, and even then He will be good for all of the time he has already given us.
