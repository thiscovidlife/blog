This blog is my record of the Coronavirus outbreak that began in the US in February 2020.  It began affecting us on March 12.

If you want hard, solid facts of every world event, you've come to the wrong place.  This is my experience and my intepretation of events, so not everything here will be accurate in a purely technical sense.  I think there's something valuable in that.

## About Me ##

I'm a web developer, meaning I build websites for a living.  I'm in my early 40's, and was in full-time ministry for a decade in the past.  During that time I was in the Army, and I went to Iraq.  I came home with PTSD that required hospitalization, and the anxiety it gave me took me out of working at the Church because of the public speaking and just the constant interpersonal interactions.  I've come a long way over the last 10 years, but I do have issues with depression and anxiety from time to time.

I'm a Christian, but I'm not angry about it.  I ask you to not judge me too quickly and I'll do the same for you.  I'm far from a Trump supporter, if that helps you understand me a bit more.

I serve in the leadership team at my church (the technical term is an "elder").  This means that in addition to our head pastor, we have two other men who are lay (read "unpaid") pastors as well.  The three of us pastor the church as equals, which means that although the paid head pastor holds a lot of responsibility, all decisions for the church are made as a group.  We make a great team.  It is our job to shepherd, guide, and serve our people, not to boss them around.

I was in the Army for 5 years, and in Iraq I served as prison guard. I helped evacuate New Orleans a few days after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. I also served as a Chaplain Assistant in Army hospitals, including experience working in a level V trauma unit.

## My Household ##

In my house we have seven people: me, my wife, three teenage kids, and my parents.  Between all of us we also have three dogs and a cat. Together, we live in the suburbs of Kansas City, Missouri.

My wife, Dani, is an experience nurse who has worked everything from nursing homes, to "the floor," to hospice.  She currently works as the nurse at a Children's Home in our area, housing young people awaiting foster homes, as well as people with Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities.  She's the most caring person I know by far, and she's smart as heck.  I trust her opinion more that anyone else's in my life.

My daughter, Kate, just turned 18 a month ago.  She's a senior in high school.  My oldest son is John, who is 15, and my youngest is Tom, aged 13.  They are my greatest treasures.  They are smart and witty and talented, and also some of the most hilarious people I know.

My Mom and Dad live with me due to health problems.  My Mom has Myasthenia Gravis, a neurological autoimmune disorder.  My Dad had a stroke just over a year ago, as well as a heart attack, triple bypass surgery, and a pacemaker put in back in August.  We have always had a good relationship, and frankly, we all really enjoy them living with us.
