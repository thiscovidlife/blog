I"<p>Just last week I was thinking through <a href="https://www.esv.org/Matthew+6/">the Lordâ€™s Prayer</a> and something hit me for the first time:</p>

<blockquote>
Our Father in heaven,<br />
hallowed be your name.<br />

 	Your kingdom come,<br />

your will be done,<br />

on earth as it is in heaven.<br />

Give us nthis day our daily bread,<br />

 	and forgive us our debts,<br />

as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br />

 	And olead us not into temptation,<br />

but deliver us from evil.<br />
</blockquote>
