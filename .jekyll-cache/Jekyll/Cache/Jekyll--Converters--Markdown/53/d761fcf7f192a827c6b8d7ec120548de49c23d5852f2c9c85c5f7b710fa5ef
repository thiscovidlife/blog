I"T<p><strong>Day 1: Thursday, March 12</strong></p>

<p>Last night I told Mollie that things that the next 24 hours would change everyting, and, unfortunately, they did.</p>

<p>So far 166,000 people worldwide have had COVID-19, and 4,300 have died.  It’s just now starting to spread in the US.  We crossed 1,000 cases yesterday, and according to the statistics we have, that number should start doubling every day now.</p>

<p>Our government has not taken this seriously.  And, accordingly, it has moved slowly.  There are dangerously few testing kids available – much lower than in other countries, so that 1,000 cases is probably much higher.</p>

<p>In Missouri, only 65 tests have been administered to date.  We have only one case, in St. Louis. Kansas has one case in Johnson County.  There are more around Omaha/Council Bluffs.</p>

<p>I’m really worried about my parents catching this.  I’m not sure my Mom could survive it.  I might start working from home as soon as tomorrow.</p>

<p>MLB, NBA, WNBA, and the NCAA basketball tournament have all been postponed/cancelled in some way.  When groups are willing to give up that kind of money, it lets me know how serious this is going to be.</p>

<p>The mayor of KC MO declared a state of emergency today.  The stock market took its largest loss since 1987 (2,300 points).  The Fed injected $1.5 Trillion into it, and it was immediately consumed and lost.</p>

<p>Tonight they announced a 70-year old man died in KCK yesterday (Wednesday).  He lived in a long-term care facility.  His autopsy showed that he had COVID-19.  This is Kansas’ first death.</p>
