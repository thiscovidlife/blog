I"}<p><strong>Day 5: Monday, March 16</strong></p>

<p>Brief Notes:</p>

<p>Stressful day, stuck between emergency and normalcy.  Hard to focus on work.  Dani and I are both working from home.</p>

<p>Louise is really freaked out, and I can’t blame  her.  She’s alone in Omaha.  Can’t go to Robin’s because Boomer just had heart surgery.</p>

<p>Went for a walk with Dani and Tom this evening.</p>

<p>I went to Walmart at 0630.  It was relatively quiet.  I bought the Lego Millenium Falcon for the boys to work on in a week or so when they’re going nuts.</p>

<p>Based on the 0% interest rate, the stock market dropped all day.</p>

<p>Trump’s press conference said it could be July/August berfore things start going back to normal.  The CDC also said to limit gatherings to 10 people.</p>

<p>In light of these things, the market was in free fall when it closed, down 3,000 pts.</p>

<p>I bought Minecraft so Tom &amp; John could play together.</p>

<p>Tonight we just watched live trail cams together on YouTube.  We’re all so stressed and tired.</p>

<p>Cass County has its first COVID-19 case now.</p>
