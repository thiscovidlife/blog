  <li>Day 4: Sunday, March 15 *</li>
</ul>

<p>Aaron Chally was sick and didnâ€™t go to church, but Lori and his kids did.  I heard there were 28 or so people there.  I watched the sermon via Facebook Live.</p>

<p>Seth and I watched <em>Outbreak</em>, a movie from the late 1990s about a pandemic.</p>

<p>I texted with Rachel and Jess for a whilue.  Overally, theyâ€™re doing okay.  Jess is still working, and so is Ben K., but it looks like theyâ€™ll be shutting down his job soon.  Rachel can thankfully work from home.</p>

<p>It sucks that Jess canâ€™t come here if she gets scared (and how could I blame her for being scared?).</p>

<p>I took the boys to Rec Park this afternoon.  It was cold and wet.  They wrestled almsto the entire way as we walked the trail around the park.  It was good for them to get some energy out, and also good for me to hear them laugh.</p>

<p>I think most people are still living life as usual.  Lots of Americans went to dinner and clubs last night, and all of my kidsâ€™ friends are trying to get together with them.  But I also think people are starting to understand what weâ€™re facing.  The CDC recommends that no groups of 50 or more meet for the next 8 weeks.</p>

<p>Last night (Saturday), all of the last flights out of the EU landed in the US.  Chicago Oâ€™Hare and DFW did not have enough Federal Customs staff to handle the traffic, and the airports were overwhelmed with people waiting up to 8 hours to leave the airport.  After this, they all flew home to points around the country.  It was horrifying, like a worst-case scenario.</p>

<p>Lots of people are going to die because of our governmentâ€™s mismanagement of this situation.</p>

<p>The Fed dropped interest rates down to 0 today.  This was a last-ditch effort to keep the economy afloat.  Weâ€™ll see how it works tomorrow morning when the markets open.</p>

<p>Tonight there are about 3,300 cases in the U S.  I think MO has 5 cases right now.  KS has 9.</p>
