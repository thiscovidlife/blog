I"¾<p><strong>Day 7: Wednesday, March 18</strong></p>

<p>Today we launched a new website at work.  It was super easy, but everyone was so impressed that there were no issues.  Big win for me.</p>

<p>I asked Kate not to go into work on Friday. Even though they will only have the drive through open, we just canâ€™t chance her bringing something home.  I feel terrible about it, but it could save lives here in our house.  The upside is that people want her shift because they need to work so badly.</p>

<p>Saw an article today on CNN about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/economy/banks-cash-coronavirus/index.html">why you should keep your money in the bank</a>.  Nothing suspicious there.</p>

<p>Omaha is shutting down their Public Schools.  Classes will continue online.</p>

<p>I held my first youth group meeting via Facebook Live video today.  It was odd just talking at a camera with no feedback.  I wish I could have led a discussion instead of just running my mouth.</p>

<p>For comaraderie at work, we started having brief meetings at the end of hte day as a chance to reconnect.  I can tell people are going to get lonely.</p>

<p>Dani had Dr. T day, where kids meet with the psychiatrist. Every month is hard.  She hears their heartbreaking stories in detail.  This time was exceptionally hard because in addition to the COVID-19 stress, the stories were exceptionally bad.  Poor kids.  Poor Dani.</p>

<p>The stock market dropped something like another 1,300 points, erasing all growth since Trump took office.  This has been his only redeeming quality in his followersâ€™ eyes.</p>

<p>Blah.  This is going to be a long time, isnâ€™t it?</p>
