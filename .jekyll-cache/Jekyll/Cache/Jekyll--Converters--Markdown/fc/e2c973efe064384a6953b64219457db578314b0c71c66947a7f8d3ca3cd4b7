I"<p><strong>Day 9: Friday, March 20</strong></p>

<p>Went to the store this morning before work.  If/when they announce a lockdown around here, everyone’s going to converge on the stores.  We got there around 7 (when they opened), and didn’t get home until after 9.  We spent about 3x more than we usually do, mostly because we had to buy name brands as well as extras of a few things. We didn’t hoard anything because there wasn’t enough of anything on the shelves to hoard.</p>

<p>Loaded up the shotgun and put it under my bed.  Dani’s usually shies away from guns, but she’s the one who made the recommendation I bring it in the house.</p>

<p>Going to the store spooked Dani this morning.  She’s been saying that all of this just feels like spring break, but I think that’s changed.</p>

<p>I texted with Charles today, and I think the alarm is gowing for him just as it has for us.</p>

<p>The news is saying that 70% of deaths in Italy have been males.  China reported that a majority of their deaths were males.</p>
