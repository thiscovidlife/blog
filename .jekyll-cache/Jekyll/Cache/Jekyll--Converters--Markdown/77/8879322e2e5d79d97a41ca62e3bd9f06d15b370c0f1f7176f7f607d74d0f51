I"1	<p>Just last week I was thinking through <a href="https://www.esv.org/Matthew+6/" target="_blank">the Lord’s Prayer</a> and something hit me for the first time.</p>

<blockquote>
Our Father in heaven,<br />
hallowed be your name.<br />
Your kingdom come,<br />
your will be done,<br />
on earth as it is in heaven.<br />
Give us this day our daily bread,<br />
and forgive us our debts,<br />
as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br />
And lead us not into temptation,<br />
but deliver us from evil.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>It was that line, “Give us this day our daily bread.”  That’s something a lot of us skim over without even noticing.  This is a cry for provision, that God would supply everything we need for the day.</p>

<p>I put myself in the feet of the disciples Jesus taught that day.  They had no homes and no jobs as they followed Jesus.  They knew hunger.  They knew the stress and worry of not knowing if they would have “enough” for the day.  This “our daily bread” really meant something important to them.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that I’ve never really been in need.  I’ve never been <em>truly</em> hungry.  I’ve never worried about what I would feed my kids.  And the fact I’ve never thought about asking for provision only demostrates how much I <em>don’t</em> depend on God to provide for me.</p>

<p>I can now see how much I depend on myself to provide what I need.  It’s all about <em>my</em> income and <em>my</em> choices.  I don’t depend on God to provide for me because I can provide for myself.</p>

<p>Of course, this is foolish.  I have nothing except what comes from God’s hand. Even my job is a gift from Him, not something I’m owed based on my experience or performance.</p>

<p>I depend on Him more than I realize, and I need to acknowledge it.  Without God’s generosity we’d all be hungry and needy.</p>

<p>So, as the economy takes its dive during this pandemic, I fear we’ll all have our eyes opened to the powerlessness we have to provide for ourselves and our loved ones.  We will lose our jobs, stores will close, and supplies will run low.  When this happens, <em>will we turn to God to provide for us?  If so, why not now?</em></p>

<p>We might not see it, but we have always needed Him just as desperately as we will with those days come, and we always will.</p>
