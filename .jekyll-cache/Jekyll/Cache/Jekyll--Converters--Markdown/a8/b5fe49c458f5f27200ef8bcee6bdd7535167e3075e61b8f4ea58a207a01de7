I"Ñ<p>Just last week I was thinking through <a href="https://www.esv.org/Matthew+6/">the Lordâ€™s Prayer</a> and something hit me for the first time:</p>

<blockquote>
Our Father in heaven,

hallowed be your name.

 	Your kingdom come,

your will be done,

on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us nthis day our daily bread,

 	and forgive us our debts,

as we also have forgiven our debtors.

 	And olead us not into temptation,

but deliver us from evil.
</blockquote>
