I" <p><strong>Day 9: Friday, March 20</strong></p>

<p>Went to the store this morning before work.  If/when they announce a lockdown around here, everyone’s going to converge on the stores.  We got there around 7 (when they opened), and didn’t get home until after 9.  We spent about 3x more than we usually do, mostly because we had to buy name brands as well as extras of a few things. We didn’t hoard anything because there wasn’t enough of anything on the shelves to hoard.</p>

<p>Loaded up the shotgun and put it under my bed.  Dani usually shies away from guns, but she’s the one who made the recommendation I bring it in the house.</p>

<p>Going to the store spooked Dani this morning.  She’s been saying that all of this just feels like spring break, but I think that’s changed.  She’s turned a corner, and this is becoming much more real.</p>

<p>I texted with Charles today, and I think the alarm is gowing for him just as it has for us.  He spent 6 hours waiting to buy a handgun today.</p>

<p>The news is saying that 70% of deaths in Italy have been males.  China reported that a majority of their deaths were males. Also, blood type A seems to be more susceptible to contracting it.</p>

<p>At work I’ve been doing emergency updates to client sites so they can announce how they’re dealing with this crisis.  It’s hard to focus.</p>

<p>At Trump’s press conference today, he attacked a reporter who asked what he’d say to Americans who are scared right now.  Psychopath.</p>

<p>My cousin B sent me a pic of the letter her work gave her in case she needs to identify herself as an essential health care worker.</p>

<p>Sounds like the National Guard is being activated, but I’m not sure.  Peopple are worried martial law is coming, but I think it’s just for humanitarian purposes, like transportation and medical aid.  We will go on lockdown eventually, but I think the police will handle that.  If rioting or looting break out, I can see the military getting involved, but think if we jump straight to marial law people will be afraid and panic.</p>

<p>There are more rumors that we will be on lockdown by the end of the weekend.</p>

<p>I pulled out that Lego Millenium Falcon for the boys.  They’ve been doing nothing but playing Minecraft all week and their brains have turned to oatmeal.  When they’re not playing, they’re fighting, and sometimes they do both at the same time.</p>

<p>We took the kids to Walmart to buy a few last things, including some ice cream.  Dani wanted them to see what things were like out in public.  The kids  haven’t left the house all week, and I don’t think they had a real appreciation for how things have changed.</p>

<p>More and more, it looks like we won’t be going back to “nomral” (whatever that means) until we get a vaccine, which could be 18 months away.  In the meantime, the economy will be at a standstill.  People aren’t going to need websites if they don’t have jobs or anything to sell.  I think by the time this is over, I’ll be doing manual labor, and Dani will probably be working with the sick in some form.</p>

<p>I’m concerned for our safety.  More this than getting sick.  When even good people are desperate, they are capable of bad things.</p>

<p>Dani thinks we my be starting the End Times, and we’re not “those” kind of people.  She makes some great points.  There is a massive swarm of locusts in Africa right now.  It is 35x25 <em>miles</em>.  It was caused by climate change creating more favorable breeding conditions over the last three years.  This is combined with the civil war in Yemen, where they haven’t been able todo their anti-locust(?) national programs.</p>

<p>This week there were earthquakes in Utah and Carson City, Nevada.</p>

<p>I have to admit it’s even possible that Trump is the antichrist.  (Wow, it <em>really</em> feels psychotic saying that)  He’s got the power and fanatical follwowing to fit the bill.</p>

<p>But we’re not ready to put our pets to sleep and wait on our rooftop for the rapture.  These are just some strange times with some parallels to predictions in scripture.</p>

<p>I guess at the end of the day, I need to be ready to see Jesus. I look forward to it, not because I want to die, but because He is my reward, the goal of my faith and life.</p>

<p><em>Amen. Come Lord Jesus.</em></p>
