I"Ë<p><strong>Day 6: Tuesday, March 17</strong></p>

<p>Brief Notes:</p>

<p>Kate, Tom, and I had teeth dreams last night.</p>

<p>Dani is having a hard time focusing, sheâ€™s glued to the numbers.</p>

<p>I met with Mike R. and Aaron C.  Discussed no on-site meetings anymore â€“ all services online.  Mike had dinner out with his in-laws on Saturday.  They came from a funeral in PA and had been through 15 states recently.  Mike also attended the celebration of life for Cayleâ€™s Dad, who died of cancer a week ago.  This was also on Saturday, and there were 100-150 people there.  Mike needs to self-quarantine.</p>

<p>Mom went to a Dr/Disability appointment, then grocery shopping. Dad stayed in the truck the entire time.</p>

<p>Kateâ€™s friend, OP, is back from college.  Kateâ€™s scheduled to work at her fast food job on Friday.  She got her hair cut last Friday.  Itâ€™s short and looks so nice.</p>

<p>John &amp; Tom played Minecraft <em>all day</em>.</p>

<p>Italy is burning down and Spain and France arenâ€™t far behind.</p>

<p>Kansas shut down their public schools for the rest of the year.  Theyâ€™ll continue online.</p>

<p>Jackson County  had its first two cases today.</p>
